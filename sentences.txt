Your first step is to choose an agent.
Your agent will receive communication from the NVC about your case.
You may act as your own agent or you may choose your petitioner, a family member, friend, attorney, immigration professional, or any other person you trust. 
You may have an agent that represented you and the petitioner in the petition process with USCIS. 
However, you will need to formally select an agent to represent you for your visa processing.
To choose your agent, complete the Choice of Address and Agent (DS261) form in the Consular Electronic Application Center.
